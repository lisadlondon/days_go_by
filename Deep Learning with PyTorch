# Classical machine learning relies on using statistics to determine relationships between features and labels, 
# and can be very effective for creating predictive models. However, a massive growth in the availability of data 
# coupled with advances in the computing technology required to process it has led to the emergence of new machine 
# learning techniques that mimic the way the brain processes information in a structure called an artificial neural network.

# PyTorch is a framework for creating machine learning models, including deep neural networks (DNNs). In this example, 
# we'll use PyTorch to create a simple neural network that classifies penguins into species based on the length and depth 
# of their culmen (bill), their flipper length, and their body mass.

# Citation: The penguins dataset used in the this exercise is a subset of data collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman]
# (https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

penguins = pd.read_csv('data/penguins.csv').dropna()

# Deep Learning models work best when features are on similar scales
# In a real solution, we'd implement some custom normalization for each feature, but to keep things simple
# we'll just rescale the FlipperLength and BodyMass so they're on a similar scale to the bill measurements
penguins['FlipperLength'] = penguins['FlipperLength']/10
penguins['BodyMass'] = penguins['BodyMass']/100

# So we'll oversample it to increase its size
